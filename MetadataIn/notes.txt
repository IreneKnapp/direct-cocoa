Our general strategy here is to parse the "Full" versions of the XML
.bridgesupport files.  These include (contrary to Apple's documentation) all
classes, not just classes with special annotations.  They also include
declared_type attributes on several element types which are useful for
Haskell with its strong type system, where two things having the same binary
format are not necessarily treated identically.

Note that we get almost everything we need from the XML; we don't need to use
ObjC's runtime reflection capabilities much at all, nice though they are.  But,
sadly, what we don't get without them is the class inheritance structure, so
we DO need to use reflection.

About that magic_cookie attribute...  There are no opaque types which use it,
so heaven knows what it would actually mean there.  There is exactly one
constant which uses it, kCFAllocatorUseContext.  We can infer that this
basically means "it is actually an out-of-band value, not a pointer".  It's not
clear how this can be modelled in Haskell, though, so I'm not going to worry
about it.
